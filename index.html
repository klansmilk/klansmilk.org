  <h1>Milk is Racist.</h1>
  <p>
    In the United States, school lunch programs require milk to be offered — and often consumed —
    with every meal. But what they don't tell you is this:
    <span class="highlight">up to 80% of Black, Asian, Indigenous, and Latino populations are lactose intolerant</span>,
    compared to only about 15% of white people.
  </p>

  <p>
    Forcing dairy on children who can't digest it isn't nutrition — it's institutional harm disguised as health.
    We call it <span class="highlight">Klansmilk</span> — because this practice has roots in white supremacist policy,
    and it continues to hurt kids today.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's time to stop pretending that cow milk is for everyone. It's time to demand nondairy alternatives, available to all.
  </p>
